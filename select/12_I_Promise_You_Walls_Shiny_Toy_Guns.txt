Loneliness is more than we'll ever feel
Blind as you are, watching everything
When we die, faith is lost once again
Taking hold of all we are

Who says we die before we live?
I promise you walls of grace
To carry on when we're lost
We'll find a way

Loneliness, or should we say something more?
Oceans arise, washing over me
Cold company, dark shades of harmony
Chasing the lies no one believes

Who says we die before we live?
I promise you walls of grace
To carry on when we're lost
We'll find a way
Walls of grace
To carry on when we're lost
We'll find a way
