I said I would promise you the world
Now I realise that was absurd
You cheated, lied and you deceived
Told me tales and I believed
You'll get your just desserts I promise you

I said I would never let you down
When you're with me I'd always be around
You pierced my soul and broke my heart
Tore my love for you apart
I'll get you back some day I promise you

And I promised you I'd be with you and never leave you
You never promised me one thing
(You never did!)
Perhaps you'll listen now it's over
Let me say, it's over and you can't do a thing

I said I would promise you the world
But that was before the tables turned
You cheated, lied and you deceived
Told me tales and I believed
You'll get your just desserts I promise you

You'll get what you deserve I promise you!
